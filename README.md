# Cryptic Metro Bundler Error in Expo CLI

This repository demonstrates a problem encountered while building an Expo app using the Expo CLI. The issue involves an intermittent and cryptic error from the Metro bundler, making debugging difficult. The error message doesn't provide enough information to pinpoint the cause or its location in the code.

## Problem Description

During the build process, the Metro bundler fails unexpectedly, displaying an error message that's insufficient for diagnosis. The error's behavior is inconsistent â€“ it occurs sporadically, making it challenging to identify the root cause. Standard debugging steps like cache clearing, dependency reinstallation, and code syntax checks were unsuccessful.

## Solution

After extensive investigation, it was discovered that the issue was related to a specific third-party library,  and a conflict with another dependency in the project.  Upgrading the conflicting library solved the problem. This repository contains code examples demonstrating the problem and its resolution.  The `bug.js` file shows code which produces the error in some conditions, while the `bugSolution.js` file displays the corrected code.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to build the Expo project using `expo start`.
4. Observe the intermittent bundler errors.
5. Replace the content of `bug.js` with `bugSolution.js` and re-run `expo start`.

Note that the error's intermittent nature means that consistent reproduction might not be guaranteed on all systems.
