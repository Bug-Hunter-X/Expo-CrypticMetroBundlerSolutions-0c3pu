While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to the Metro bundler. The specific error message was quite cryptic, and it wasn't immediately clear what caused it. I tried various solutions like cleaning the cache, reinstalling dependencies, and checking my code for syntax errors, but nothing worked.  The error seemed intermittent, sometimes appearing and sometimes not, making debugging even more challenging.  A particularly frustrating aspect was that the error message didn't pinpoint a specific location in the code. The bundler simply failed without providing enough context to diagnose the problem.  I've included a simplified version of my project structure and relevant code snippets for demonstration.
